## ðŸ’¡ Project Idea
NovelNest is a multi-functional book platform that allows users to:

    - Discover books through personalized recommendations based on their preferences (genre, author, etc.).
    - Read books online or listen using a text-to-speech (TTS) feature.
    - Watch video reviews of books to make informed choices.
    - Buy and sell books through a built-in marketplace.
    - Save favorite books for later reading.
    - Upload books for sale or sharing.

NovelNest tailors suggestions based on user inputs during signup and search interactions to ensure a more intuitive and user-driven experience.
